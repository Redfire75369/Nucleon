## Resource Generation
This pack uses a unique method of resource generation which will be using Energy's Matter, a custom mod being made for 
this pack by [TheSilkMiner](https://github.com/TheSilkMiner). In the early game, you will be able to transmute items and 
blocks into other items or blocks. However, it is not able to materialise any new items and is only able to materialise raw materials. 
As for the later stages of the game, you will scan an item and get a molecular schema of the item. This molecular schema can then 
be used with an immense amount of power to create the item with just energy. A more detailed explanation can be found 
[here](https://github.com/Redfire75369/FactorumUltimation/blob/master/docs/Energy's_Matter.md). <br/>
