			"text": "Clusters are simply connected groups of heat-conducting components. Components which can be in an active or idle state only conduct heat when functional, while passive blocks such as conductor blocks always do. Moderator and reflector blocks do $(l)not$() make up clusters. The components share a combined heat level, so will collectively overheat if they get too hot."
