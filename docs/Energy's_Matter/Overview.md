# Energy's Matter
Energy's Matter is a custom mod made for Nucleon.
It contains various ways to generate power and resources throughout the entire game.
The setups needed to generate power and resources consistently is a challenging one requiring the right balance of every aspect of the mod.
Many parts of this mod are scientifically accurate but are implemented in such a way as to be as engaging as possible. 
Scientific Explanations on how the machines work can be found at the bottom of the page for each feature.
