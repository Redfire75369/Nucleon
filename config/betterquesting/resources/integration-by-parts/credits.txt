Obviously all mods that themes are based on belong to their respective owners.
In addition, the Sooty Marble texture from Astral Sorcery and Large Bloodstone Bricks texture from Blood Magic belong to their respective teams.

All other textures are my work. Feel free to use in your modpack! I'd be happy to know my themes are circulating.
